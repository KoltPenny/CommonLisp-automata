# CommonLisp-automata
A simple automata written in Common Lisp

The automata only checks if the string belongs to its language.
Qs is a file with some graph (table) examples on how the automata reads through strings:
  
  (-current state- (-symbol read- -state returned-) ... -t or nil-)

The lines that are accept states have a t at the end.
